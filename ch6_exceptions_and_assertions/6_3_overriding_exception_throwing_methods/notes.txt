When overriding a method that throws a checked exception the overriding method must obey the following rules:
- the overriding method can declare to throw no checked exceptions
- the overriding method can declare to throw an equivalent exception
- the overriding method can declare to throw an exception that is a subclass of the exception thrown by the overridden method
- the overriding method cannot declare to throw an exception that is a superclass of the exception being thrown by the 
overridden method. 

If the overridden method declares no thrown exceptions then an overriding method cannot declare to throw any checked exception. 
The overriding method  can however throw a RuntimeException.
