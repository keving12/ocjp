Creating custom checked exceptions can be done by implementing a class that extends Exception. It is I'll advised to write 
custom exceptions that extend throwable. This is because if the exception is caught as a Throwable then it could lead to other 
errors being caught such as OutOfMemoryError which could lead to unexpected behaviour. 

To create a custom unchecked exception we can define a class that extends RuntimeException. This can be thrown in the same way 
as any checked exception except now it is not required to be declared in any throws clause or handled in a try-catch.
