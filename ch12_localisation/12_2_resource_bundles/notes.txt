Resources that are specific to a locale are represented by the class java.util.ResourceBundle. Within these resource bundles are resources such
as text labels and location of images or icons. All resource bundles should share a common base name with the distinction being made by specifying 
region, language or variant.

ListResourceBundle and PropertyResourceBundle are subclasses of the abstract class Resourcebundle. Resources can then be defined in properties files or as two-dimensional
Object arrays stored within a custom class that extends ListResourceBundle.

To implement resource bundles using PropertyResourceBundle text files must be created with the extension '.properties'. Each of these properties files is a 
resource bundle and collectively are referred to as a resource bundle family.

To use a ResourceBundle we call the static method getBundle() passing as arguments the name of the message bundle family and the Locale and loads a single
resource bundle. A default bundle will be loaded in the event that the Locale information supplied does not match a resource bundle. In the event that the 
Locale information supplied is not an exact match it will try to resolve the closest resource bundle. For example the resource bundle messages_fr.properties
would be loaded if the locale information was Locale.CANDA_FRENCH.

Defining resource bundles using a class that extends ResourceBundle requires implementing the protected method getContents(). This
method returns a two-dimensional array with each inner array containing a key and a value. When using this class as a resource bundle
the package name of the class must also be specified otherwise a MissingResourceException is thrown at runtime.

In the event that a resource bundle cannot be identified for a given locale then the base resource bundle, the one with no language
or country information associated with it is loaded. The compiler will try to locate a resource bundle in the following order
 - Using specified locale language, country and variant
 - As above without the variant
 - Using specified locale language only
 - Using default locale language, country and variant
 - As above without the variant
 - Using default locale language only
 - Base resource, no locale information just name of resource bundle
