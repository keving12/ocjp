The purpose of the DAO design pattern is to abstract out access to data stores. It manages to connection to the data store and then access
to the records. Details about the how the data is stored (text file, database) and how it is accessed is hidden away from the client. 
Hiding this information from the client means the technology used to store the data can be changed without affecting the client.

It is possible to make use of the factory pattern along with the DAO pattern to support access to multiple data sources within an application.

Benefits of using the DAO pattern include:
- Promotes programming to an interface, hides implementation of data access logic from clients who make use of it
- Decouples business logic from persistence mechanism. Any change to the persistence mechanism can be made independent of any of the application code.
