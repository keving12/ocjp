The factory pattern allows for creation of an object while hiding the implemetation details of how this happens by elimintating direct constructor
calls. 
Three type of factory pattern exist - Simple or static factory pattern,  factory method pattern and abstract factory pattern.

Simple Factory pattern creates and returns objects of of a class that extend a common base class or implement a common interface. The factory abstracts away from
the client the specific class needed to perform some task. I.e we go to a dealer when we want to buy a car rather than asking a factory to build us one.
The building of the car is abstracted away from us by the dealer.

Factory method pattern differs from the simple factory method pattern in that there is another layer of inheritance abstracting away the instantiation
of an object. A factory will delegate responsibilty for instantiation to its subclasses. I.e if I want baked goods, more specifically an apple pie I would 
request an apple pie factory. This will then return an apple pie instance of the baked goods interface. The benefit of this is if I decide my apple pie
factory only produces apple and blackberry pies I can change the concrete instance returned from the apple pie factory and clients would have no idea.
