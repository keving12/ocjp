Transactions provide a mechanism to ensure that all JDBC operations in a group execute successfully before writing those 
changes to disk. In the event that any single operation should fail then none of the previous or subsequent operations will be 
persisted. 

By default the Connection class has the value autoCommit set to true. We can change this to false by calling the setAutoCommit 
method. When autoCommit is set to false we are required to explicitly call commit on the Connection object at the end of 
successful database update operations. 

It is possible to set save points when executing a number of SQL update operations. This allows for rolling back to the last 
set of successful updates where a save point was created rather than losing the entire set of attempted update operations. 
The commit mode of a connection cannot be set during execution of a transaction. If this is attempted an exception is thrown 
when trying to call commit() or rollback() on that connection.
