Precompiled statements are beneficial over non compiled statements as they are more performant and prevent the possibility of 
SQL injection attacks. SQL injection is prevented by the use of placeholders that accept parameters for update values or 
where conditions. This removes the possibility of injecting SQL commands into strings used in statement objects. 

PreparedStatement is one instance of a precompiled statement. The first difference between this and a Statement object is 
that the SQL command to be used must be passed to the creation of a PreparedStatement. 
An example of a query using placeholders with a PreparedStatement is as follows:

PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE myTable SET name = ? WHERE id = ?"); 

We can then set the values of these placeholders using indexes that reference their position in the string as follows:

statement.setString(1, "Kevin"); 
statement.setInt(2, 17);
