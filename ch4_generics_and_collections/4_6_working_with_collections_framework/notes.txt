At the top level of the Collection framework is the Iterable interface which enables collection classes to access and iterator
in order to iterate over the object within a collection. The Iterable interface is extended by the Collection interface which is in turn
extended by the List, Set and Queue interfaces.

Nearly all of the concrete classes within the collection framework provide two constructors, a default constructor and a songle arg 
constructor that takes a collection argument.
The first creates an empty collection, the second creates a new collection object containing all of the objects within the collection
argument excluding any objects that don't fit.

Methods of the collection interface can be broken up into four categories, addition methods, removal methods, query methods
and miscellaneous methods.

== addition methods == 
add() - adds object to the collection
addAll() - takes a collection object as argument and adds all of the objects of the collection argument to the collection the method was called on

== removal methods ==
clear() - removes all elements from the collection
remove() - takes an Object argument and removes it from the collection
removeAll() - takes a collection object as argument and removes all of the objects of the collection argument from the collection the method was called on.
retainAll() - takes a collection object as argument and all objects are removed from the collection this method was called on that don't exist in the collection argument

== query methods ==
contains() - takes an object argument and returns true if the collection has that object within it, false otherwise
equals() - takes an object argument and compares if the object is equal to the collection object this method was called on
isEmpty() - returns true if the collection is empty, false otherwise
size() - return the count of the number of elements in the collection

== miscellaneous == 
iterator() - Returns an iterator to iterate over the objects within the collection
toArray() - returns an array containing the elements of the collection this method was called on
