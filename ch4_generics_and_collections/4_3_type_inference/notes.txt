Java 7 uses type inference allow developer to instantiate a generic class without specifying the type parameter twice.
Before Java 7 instantiation of a generic class had to be done as follows:
List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>();
In the above the type parameter String is defined twice but as of Java 7 there is no need to specify the redundant second type parameter as
Java now uses type inference. 
List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();

Java cannot use the diamond to infer the type of an argument passed to a method but can infer the type from the actual argument. For example
if an Integer object was passed to a generic method Java can infer that the type is an Integer.
