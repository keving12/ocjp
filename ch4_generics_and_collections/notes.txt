The purpose of generics in Java is to define the types of objects that a piece of code is designed to work with. This enables the Java compiler
to check on the types of objects that are being used within a piece of code to make sure that it is compatible. One of the benefits of performing this 
compile time checking are that the likelihood of run time failures within a piece of code are minimised as there is no chance that an operation
will be called on an object that doesn't support it.
