Java naming conventions are such that uppercase single characters should be used when defining type parameters. This makes them easier to 
distinguish from other variables and methods within a class.

It is possible to use the name of another class as a type parameter and still be generic. Example:

class MyClass {}
public class Parcel<MyClass> { 

    public void set(MyClass t) { }  // MyClass here refers to the type parameter declared at the top of the class, not the actual class MyClass
}
