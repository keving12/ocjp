Using regular expressions in Java enables searching strings for strings that match a particular pattern. Rather than restricting 
searches to require a full match against a particular string we can define attributes of a string that we want to find using a regex.
Using regexes we can define attributes of a string that we want to match against such as string starting with or ending 
with particular characters or the number of characters in a string.

Character classes are a set of characters enclosed in square brackets. Java will attempt to match a string against any of the 
characters in the character set.

The end() method of the Matcher class returns an int to signal the index of the input string where a target string ends. However
it points to the index of the character that occurs after the last character of the target string. I.e if the target string exists 
between characters 12 and 20 the end() method returns 21.

Invalid regexes passed to a Pattern object throw PatternSyntaxException.
