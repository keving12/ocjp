A thread has a number of states and instantiation of a thread does not begin its execution. Methods can be called on a thread
to change it from one state to another. Some methods can only be called on a thread when it is in a particular state. 

The different states of a thread are:
- NEW
- READY
- RUNNING
- WAITING
- TIMED_WAITING
- BLOCKED
- TERMINATED

The different state changes and the method calls that achieve them are below:

NEW -> READY: start() method is called and the thread is ready for execution 
READY -> RUNNING: Chosen by the thread scheduler for execution
RUNNING -> READY: Suspended by thread scheduler or yield() method called
RUNNING -> TERMINATED: Thread execution completes
RUNNING -> WAITING: 
RUNNING -> TIMED_WAITING
RUNNING -> BLOCKED
WAITING -> READY
WAITING -> TERMINATED
TIMED_WAITING -> READY
TIMED_WAITING -> TERMINATED
BLOCKED -> READY
BLOCKED -> TERMINATED
